Project Title:
University Health Services Appoitment Tool

Project Description:
This is a tool that allows students or faculty to book 
and edit appointments regarding the covid 19 protocols. 
As such, this tool allows users to schedule both 
vaccinations and testing appointments.

How to Use the Project:
Once on the home page, the user either view their 
logged appointments or schedule a new one. To schedule 
a new one, click the respective button, then on the 
new page select the appropriate appointment information
(date, location, type, and time) and click 'add to my 
appointments'. On the 'My Appointments' page, users may
cancel an upcoming appointment by clicking the 
respective 'cancel' button.

Bonus:
Making the page responsive: The split columns for the 
page's progressive disclosure dynamically change their 
sizing based on the screen size. This keeps each side's 
respective elements within each column.
Some interesting and useful JavaScript functionality:
The JavaScript only allows users to book one appointment 
of each type and users cannot book the same appointment 
twice. This feature makes use of the JavaScript function
alert() to remind users. 
Add product pages for all your products: Instead of having
multiple product pages, this project has users create the 
object before appending it to the array. To satisfy this
bonus, this project has a element that automatically updates
on the 'my appointments' page that can  dynamically display 
any combination of appointment times, types, dates, or locations.
